## About Me

Hi, I'm Glauco Pacheco, the creator of Kourier, the fastest, lightest, and 100% HTTP syntax-compliant server. Kourier leaves all publicly available alternatives in the dust, as shown by the reproducible, container-based benchmarks in Kourier's repository.
<br /><br />
I designed Kourier targeting enterprise network appliances/solutions and made it open source to allow businesses to assess Kourier's performance, reliability, and compliance.
<br /><br />
As I have zero social media usage, I wrote this page for anyone interested in Kourier and wanting to know more about me.
<br /><br />
I'm a mechanical engineer with almost a decade of experience in the oil industry, where I worked designing, testing, and constructing subsea equipment, a safety-critical field where the "fail fast, fail often" mantra does not apply.
<br /><br />
In my [Masters Dissertation](https://kourier.io/files/dissertation.pdf), I wrote Fm@, a Fortran 90-based multibody simulator that automatically generated and solved the equations of motion for arbitrary mechanisms. I implemented an ODE solver based on a predictor-corrector Adams-Bashforth Adams-Moulton method with automatic adaptive step-size selection. Using OpenGL and the Win32 bindings provided by Compaq Visual Fortran, Fm@ allowed models to be built using a cad-like interface. At that time, I was astonished that Fm@ was much faster than MSC ADAMS, an enterprise multibody simulator used to validate the Fm@ solver.
<br /><br />
While struggling with the Win32 API, I started looking at C++ and met Qt. Qt changed the way I saw software. Two talented developers created a framework light-years ahead of the unwieldy Win32 API. Qt's *"this is the way that things were always meant to be"* motto was, in fact, true. Qt showed me that talent, curiosity, and ingenuity can defy the status quo. Kourier is built with this same spirit.
<br /><br />
Passionate about programming, I applied my strong engineering mindset to software development. Kourier is built following a rigorous testing process that guides its design and defines how it should behave. This process delivers software that lasts - software that works "by the book" and behaves as specified. If you check all spec files (files ending with .spec.cpp) in Kourier's repository, you will see how meticulously tested and designed Kourier is. I invite you to compare Kourier's testing process and comprehensiveness against other servers/frameworks (just looking for/at their test files is enough...).
<br /><br />
Before Kourier, I developed Cute, a communication framework that extended Qt's signals and slots to network programming. However, the most used feature of Cute was its support for HTTP-based communication. Also, the fact that Cute was closed-source was an overwhelming barrier to its adoption by larger companies. So, I changed its name, made it open source with the AGPL license, and changed its business model from subscription-based to a model based on code licensing.
